O Lord, we humbly implore Thee that as Thine Apostle Saint Andrew did
heed the call of Thy Son Jesus Christ, Thou wouldst grant us Thy grace to
serve Thee faithfully in our various vocations, through Jesus Christ, Thy
Son, our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Ghost,
ever One God, world without end, Amen.

Epistle. Romans 10:10-18.

For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth
confession is made unto salvation. For the Scripture says, “Whoever be-
lieves on Him will not be put to shame.” For there is no distinction be-
tween Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call
upon Him. For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
How then shall they cail on Him in whom they have not believed? And
how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how
shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach unless
they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who
preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!” But
they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has be-
369

lieved our report?” So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the
word of God. But I say, have they not heard? Yes indeed: “Their sound has
gone out to all the earth, And their words to the ends of the world.”

Gospel. Matthew 4:18-22.

And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called
Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were
fishermen. Then He said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fish-
ers of men.” They immediately left their nets and followed Him. Going
on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and
John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their
nets, He called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father,
and followed Him.

Epistle. Hebrews 7:23-27.

Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from
continuing. But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable
priesthood. Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who
come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession
for them. For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heav-
ens; who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices,
first for His own sins and then for the people’s, for this He did once for all
when He offered up Himself.

“For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who
called his own servants and delivered his goods to them. And to one he
gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according
to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey. Then he who
had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made an-
other five talents. And likewise he who had received two gained two more
also, But he who had received one went and dug in the ground, and hid
his lord’s money. After a long time the lord of those servants came and
settled accounts with them. So he who had received five talents came and
brought five other talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents;
look, I have gained five more talents besides them.’ His lord said to him,
‘Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things,
I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord,’
He also who had received two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered

His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant: you have been

Epistle. 2 Timothy 4:1-8.

I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will
judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom: Preach
the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort,
with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will come when they
will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, be-
cause they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers;
and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to
fables. But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of
an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. For J am already being poured out as a
drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the
good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Finally, there is

“You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be
seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled
underfoot by men. You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a
hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket,
but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your
light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify
your Father in heaven, Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the
Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill, For assuredly, I say to
you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means
pass from the law till all is fulfilled. Whoever therefore breaks one of the
least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in
the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven.”

“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a

buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking
beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went
and sold all that he had and bought it. Again, the kingdom of heaven is
like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some of every kind,
which, when it was full, they drew to shore; and they sat down and gath-
ered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away. So it will be at the end
of the age. The angels will come forth, separate the wicked from among
the just, and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and
gnashing of teeth,” Jesus said to them, “Have you understood all these
things?” They said to Him, “Yes, Lord.” Then He said to them, “There-
fore every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a
householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.”

Now Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them when Je-

So he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put
my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, Iwill not
believe.” And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas
with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said,
“Peace to you!” Then He said to Thomas, “Reach your finger here, and look at
My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side, Do not be un-
believing, but believing.” And Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord
and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Thomas, because you have seen Me, you
have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”
And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are
not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is
the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.

Remember those who rule over you, who have spoken the word of God
to you, whose faith follow, considering the outcome of their conduct. Je-
sus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do not be carried
about with various and strange doctrines. For it is good that the heart be
established by grace, not with foods which have not profited those who
have been occupied with them. We have an altar from which those who
serve the tabernacle have no right to eat. For the bodies of those animals,
whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are
burned outside the camp. Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the
378

people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate. Therefore let us go
forth to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach. For here we have
no continuing city, but we seek the one to come. Therefore by Him let us
continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips,
giving thanks to His name. But do not forget to do good and to share, for
with such sacrifices God is well pleased. Obey those who rule over you,
and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must
give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would
be unprofitable for you.

Epistle. Acts 6:8-7:60.

And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among
the people. Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of
the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia),
disputing with Stephen. And they were not able to resist the wisdom and
the Spirit by which he spoke. Then they secretly induced men to say, “We
have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.” And
they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came
upon him, seized him, and brought him to the council. They also set up
false witnesses who said, “This man does not cease to speak blasphemous
380

words against this holy place and the law; for we have heard him say that
this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs
which Moses delivered to us.” And all who sat in the council, looking
steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel. Then the high
priest said, “Are these things so?” And he said, “Brethren and fathers,
listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in
Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, and said to him, ‘Get out of your
country and from your relatives, and come to a land that 1 will show you,’
Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And
from there, when his father was dead, He moved him to this land in which
you now dwell, And God gave him no inheritance in it, not even enough
to set his foot on. But even when Abraham had no child, He promised to
give it to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him. But God
spoke in this way: that his descendants would dwell in a foreign land, and
that they would bring them into bondage and oppress them four hundred
years. ‘And the nation to whom they will be in bondage I will judge,’ said
God, ‘and after that they shall come out and serve Me in this place.’ Then
He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham begot Isaac
and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob
begot the twelve patriarchs. And the patriarchs, becoming envious, sold
Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him and delivered him out of all his
troubles, and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh,
king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
Now a famine and great trouble came over all the land of Egypt and Ca-
naan, and our fathers found no sustenance. But when Jacob heard that
there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. And the second
time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family became
known to the Pharaoh. Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and
all his relatives to him, seventy-five people. $o Jacob went down to Egypt;
and he died, he and our fathers. And they were carried back to Shechem
and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the
sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. But when the time of the promise
drew near which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multi-
plied in Egypt till another king arose who did not know Joseph. This man
dealt treacherously with our people, and oppressed our forefathers, mak-
ing them expose their babies, so that they might not live. At this time
Moses was born, and was well pleasing to God; and he was brought up in
his father’s house for three months. But when he was set out, Pharaoh’s
381

daughter took him away and brought him up as her own son, And Moses
was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words
and deeds, Now when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to
visit his brethren, the children of Israel. And seeing one of them suffer
wrong, he defended and avenged him who was oppressed, and struck
down the Egyptian. For he supposed that his brethren would have under-
stood that God would deliver them by his hand, but they did not under-
stand, And the next day he appeared to two of them as they were fighting,
and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brethren; why do you
wrong one another?’ But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him
away, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Do you want to
kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?’ Then, at this saying, Moses
fled and became a dweller in the land of Midian, where he had two sons.
And when forty years had passed, an Angel of the Lord appeared to him
in a flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, When Moses
saw it, he marveled at the sight; and as he drew near to observe, the voice
of the Lord came to him, saying, ‘I am the God of your fathers—the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ And Moses trembled
and dared not look. ‘Then the Lord said to him, “Take your sandals off
your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground. I have surely seen
the oppression of My people who are in Egypt; I have heard their groan-
ing and have come down to deliver them, And now come, I will send you
to Egypt.’” This Moses whom they rejected, saying, ‘Who made you a rul-
er and a judge?’ is the one God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the
hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the bush. He brought them out,
after he had shown wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red
Sea, and in the wilderness forty years. This is that Moses who said to the
children of Israel, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like
me from your brethren. Him you shall hear.’ This is he who was in the
congregation in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him on
Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, the one who received the living ora-
cles to give to us, whom our fathers would not obey, but rejected. And in
their hearts they turned back to Egypt, saying to Aaron, ‘Make us gods to
go before us; as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we
do not know what has become of him.’ And they made a calf in those days,
offered sacrifices to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands,
Then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is
written in the book of the Prophets: ‘Did you offer Me slaughtered ani-
382

mals and sacrifices during forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
You also took up the tabernacle of Moloch, And the star of your god Rem-
phan, Images which you made to worship; And I will carry you away be-
yond Babylon.’ Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilder-
ness, as He appointed, instructing Moses to make it according to the
pattern that he had seen, which our fathers, having received it in turn,
also brought with Joshua into the land possessed by the Gentiles, whom
God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David, who
found favor before God and asked to find a dwelling for the God of Jacob.
But Solomon built Him a house. However, the Most High does not dwell in
temples made with hands, as the prophet says: ‘Heaven is My throne, And
earth is My footstool, What house will you build for Me? says the Lord, Or
what is the place of My rest? Has My hand not made all these things?’ You
stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the
Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you, Which of the prophets did your
fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of
the Just One, of whom you now have become the betrayers and murder-
ers, who have received the law by the direction of angels and have not
kept it. When they heard these things they were cut to the heart, and
they gnashed at him with their teeth. But he, being full of the Holy Spirit,
gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the
right hand of God, and said, “Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son
of Man standing at the right hand of God!” Then they cried out with a
loud voice, stopped their ears, and ran at him with one accord; and they
cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down
their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. And they stoned Ste-
phen as he was calling on God and saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”
Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not charge
them with this sin.” And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

Epistle. 1 John 1:1-10.

That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have
seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled,
concerning the Word of life—the life was manifested, and we have seen, and
bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with the Father
and was manifested to us—that which we have seen and heard we declare to
you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is
with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. And these things we write to
you that your joy may be full. This is the message which we have heard from
Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. if
we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do
not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have
fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
us from all sin. if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive
us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we
have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.

This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when
He had spoken this, He said to him, “Follow Me.” Then Peter, turning

around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had leaned
on His breast at the supper, and said, “Lord, who is the one who betrays
You?” Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, “But Lord, what about this man?”
Jesus said to him, “If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you?
You follow Me.” Then this saying went out among the brethren that this
disciple would not die, Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not
die, but, “If 1 will that he remain till 1 come, what is that to you?” This is
the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we

redeemed from the earth. These are the ones who were not defiled with

Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young
Child to destroy Him.” When he arose, he took the young Child and His
mother by night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of
Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through
the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called My Son.” Then Herod, when he
saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and
he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethle-

the time which he had determined from the wise men. Then was fuifilled

Then Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the
Lord, went to the high priest and asked letters from him to the synagogues
393

of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men
or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. As he journeyed he
came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heav-
en. Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul,
Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” And he said, “Who are You, Lord?”
Then the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. It is hard for
you to kick against the goads.” So he, trembling and astonished, said,
“Lord, what do You want me to do?” Then the Lord said to him, ‘Arise
and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.” And the men
who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice but seeing no
one. Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he
saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought him into Damas-
cus. And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank. Now
there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias: and to him the
Lord said in a vision, “Ananias,” And he said, “Here I am, Lord.” So the
Lord said to him, “Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire
at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he is pray-
ing. And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and put-
ting his hand on him, so that he might receive his sight.” Then Ananias
answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much fb]
harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem. And here he has authority
from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name.” But the Lord
said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before
Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel. For I will show him how many
things he must suffer for My name’s sake.” And Ananias went his way and
entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul,
the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me
that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” Im-
mediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received
his sight at once; and he arose and was baptized. So when he had received
food, he was strengthened. Then Saul spent some days with the disciples
at Damascus. Immediately he preached the Christ in the synagogues, that
He is the Son of God. Then all who heard were amazed, and said, “Is this
not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and
has come here for that purpose, so that he might bring them bound to the
chief priests?” But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confound-
ed the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this Jesus is the Christ.

From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church. And
when they had come to him, he said to them: “You know, from the first day
that I came to Asia, in what manner I always lived among you, serving the
Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me by
the plotting of the Jews; how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but pro-
claimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house, testify-
ing to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our
Lord Jesus Christ. And see, now I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not
knowing the things that will happen to me there, except that the Holy Spirit
testifies in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me. But none
of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may
finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Je-
sus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. And indeed, now I know that
you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my
face no more. Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the
blood of all men. For Ihave not shunned to declare to you the whole coun-
sel of God. Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among
which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God
which He purchased with His own blood. For I know this, that after my de-
parture savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. Also
from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw
away the disciples after themselves. Therefore watch, and remember that
for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears. So
now, brethren, | commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which
is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who
are sanctified, | have coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel. Yes, you
yourselves know that these hands have provided for my necessities, and

laborers are few; therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out labor-

wolves. Carry neither money bag, knapsack, nor sandals; and greet no

And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and

Epistle. Romans 10:5-17.

For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, “The man
who does those things shall live by them.” But the righteousness of faith
speaks in this way, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heav-
401

en?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down from above) or, “ ‘Who will descend
into the abyss?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what
does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart”
(that is, the word of faith which we preach): that if you confess with your
mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him
from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto
righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto saivation. For
the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.”
For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over
all is rich to all who call upon Him. For “whoever calls on the name of the
Lord shall be saved.” How then shall they call on Him in whom they have
not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not
heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they
preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet
of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good
things!” But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord,
who has believed our report?” So then faith comes by hearing, and hear-
ing by the word of God,

“Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy
Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became
a guide to those who arrested Jesus; for he was numbered with us and ob-

wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and
all his entrails gushed out. And it became known to all those dwelling in
Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is,
Field of Blood.) “For it is written in the Book of Psalms: ‘Let his dwelling
place be desolate, And let no one live in it’; and, ‘Let another take his of-
fice.’ Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that
the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of
John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must be-
come a witness with us of His resurrection.” And they proposed two: Jo-
seph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias, And they
prayed and said, “You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which
of these two You have chosen to take part in this ministry and apostle-
ship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own
place.” And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias, And he was

also. But he who had received one went and dug in the ground, and hid

settled accounts with them. So he who had received five talents came and
brought five other talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents;
look, I have gained five more talents besides them.’ His lord said to him,
‘Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things,

is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His
name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”

come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is
with you; blessed are you among women!” But when she saw him, she was
troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was.
Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found
favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring
forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus. He will be great, and will be

called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne

to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the High-
est will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born
will be called the Son of God. Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also
conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her
who was called barren. For with God nothing will be impossible.” Then
Mary said, “Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according
to your word,” And the angel departed from her.

“Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me.
In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have
told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place
for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am,
there you may be also. And where I go you know, and the way you know.”
Thomas said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, and
how can we know the way?” Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth,
and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. If you had
known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you
know Him and have seen Him.” Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Fa-
ther, and it is sufficient for us.” Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you
so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has
seen the Father: so how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Do you not be-
lieve that Iam in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak
to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in
Me does the works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in
Me, or else believe Me for the sake of the works themselves. Most assur-
edly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do
also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.
And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be
glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.”

For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves

to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of
the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have
this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be
of God and not of us. We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed;
we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck
down, but not destroyed— always carrying about in the body the dying of
the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the
life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh, So then death is
working in us, but life in you. And since we have the same spirit of faith,

“when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For assuredly, I

Son of Man comes. A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above
his master. It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a
servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beel-
zebub, how much more will they call those of his household! Therefore do
not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and
hidden that will not be known. Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in
the light; and what you hear in the ear, preach on the housetops. And do
not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear
Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”

power, giving counsel by their understanding, and declaring prophecies:
Leaders of the people by their counsels, and by their knowledge of learn-
ing meet for the people, wise and eloquent are their instructions: Such
as found out musical tunes, and recited verses in writing: Rich men fur-
nished with ability, living peaceably in their habitations: All these were
honoured in their generations, and were the glory of their times. There
be of them, that have left a name behind them, that their praises might
be reported. And some there be, which have no memorial; who are per-
ished, as though they had never been; and are become as though they had
418

never been born; and their children after them. But these were merciful
men, whose righteousness hath not been forgotten. With their seed shall
continually remain a good inheritance, and their children are within the
covenant. Their seed standeth fast, and their children for their sakes.

about with various and strange doctrines. For it is good that the heart be
established by grace, not with foods which have not profited those who
have been occupied with them. We have an altar from which those who
serve the tabernacle have no right to eat. For the bodies of those animals,
whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are
burned outside the camp. Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the
people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate. Therefore let us go
forth to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach. For here we have
no continuing city, but we seek the one to come. Therefore by Him let us
420

continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips,
giving thanks to His name. But do not forget to do good and to share, for
with such sacrifices God is well pleased. Obey those who rule over you,

give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would

Now Elizabeth’s full time came for her to be delivered, and she brought
forth a son. When her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had
shown great mercy to her, they rejoiced with her. So it was, on the eighth
day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called
him by the name of his father, Zacharias. His mother answered and said,
“Jo: he shall be called John.” But they said to her, “There is no one among
your relatives who is called by this name.” So they made signs to his fa-
ther—what he would have him called. And he asked for a writing tablet,
and wrote, saying, “His name is John.” So they all marveled. Immediate-
ly his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, praising
God. Then fear came on all who dwelt around them; and all these sayings
were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea. And all those who
heard them kept them in their hearts, saying, ‘What kind of child will
this be?” And the hand of the Lord was with him. Now his father Zacha-
rias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying: “Blessed is
the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited and redeemed His people, And
has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of His servant David,
As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, Who have been since the
world began, That we should be saved from our enemies And from the
hand of all who hate us, To perform the mercy promised to our fathers
And to remember His holy covenant, The oath which He swore to our fa-
ther Abraham: To grant us that we, Being delivered from the hand of our
enemies, Might serve Him without fear, In holiness and righteousness be-
fore Him all the days of our life. And you, child, will be called the prophet
of the Highest; For you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His
ways, To give knowledge of salvation to His people By the remission of ,
423

their sins, Through the tender mercy of our God, With which the Day-
spring from on high has visited us; To give light to those who sit in dark-
ness and the shadow of death, To guide our feet into the way of peace.”
So the child grew and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till
the day of his manifestation to Israel.

Now about that time Herod the king stretched out his hand to harass
some from the church. Then he killed James the brother of John with the
sword. And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
to seize Peter also, Now it was during the Days of Unleavened Bread. So
when he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to
four squads of soldiers to keep him, intending to bring him before the
people after Passover. Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant
prayer was offered to God for him by the church, And when Herod was
about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two
426

chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keep-
ing the prison, Now behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light
shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up,
saying, “Arise quickly!” And his chains fell off his hands. Then the angel
said to him, “Gird yourself and tie on your sandals”; and so he did. And
he said to him, “Put on your garment and follow me.” So he went out
and followed him, and did not know that what was done by the angel
was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. When they were past the
first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to
the city, which opened to them of its own accord; and they went out and
went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.
And when Peter had come to himself, he said, “Now I know for certain
that the Lord has sent His angel, and has delivered me from the hand of
Herod and from all the expectation of the Jewish people.”

Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for
flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in
heaven. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will
build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. And

Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste,

the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spir-

women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! But why is this granted to
me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For indeed, as soon
as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my
womb for joy. Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment
of those things which were told her from the Lord.” And Mary said: “My
soul magnifies the Lord, And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior. For
He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant; For behold, hence-
forth all generations will call me blessed, For He who is mighty has done
great things for me, And holy is His name. And His mercy is on those who
fear Him From generation to generation. He has shown strength with His
arm; He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He
has put down the mighty from their thrones, And exalted the lowly. He
has filled the hungry with good things, And the rich He has sent away
empty. He has helped His servant Israel, In remembrance of His mercy, As

Epistle. Song of Solomon 3:2-5; 8:6-7.

“1 will rise now,” I said, “And go about the city; In the streets and in the
squares I will seek the one I love.” I sought him, but I did not find him.
The watchmen who go about the city found me; I said, “Have you seen the
one I love?” Scarcely had I passed by them, When I found the one I love. I
held him and would not let him go, Until I had brought him to the house
of my mother, And into the chamber of her who conceived me. I charge
you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the does of the field,
Do not stir up nor awaken love Until it pleases. ... Set me as a seal upon
your heart, As a seal upon your arm; For love is as strong as death, Jeal-
ousy as cruel as the grave; Its flames are flames of fire, A most vehement
flame, Many waters cannot quench love, Nor can the floods drown it. If
430

aman would give for love All the wealth of his house, It would be utterly
despised.

Gospel. Luke 7:36-50.

Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to
the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat, And behold, a woman in the
city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the
Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil, and stood at
His feet behind Him weeping: and she began to wash His feet with her
tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet
- and anointed them with the fragrant oil. Now when the Pharisee who had
invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “This Man, if He were
a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is
touching Him, for she is a sinner.” And Jesus answered and said to him,
“Simon, I have something to say to you.” So he said, “Teacher, say it.”
“There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hun-
dred denarii, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing with which
to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them
will love him more?” Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom
he forgave more.” And He said to him, “You have rightly judged.” Then
He turned to the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I en-
tered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed
My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. You
gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the
time I came in. You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has
anointed My feet with fragrant oil. Therefore | say to you, her sins, which
are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven,
the same loves little.” Then He said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” And
those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, “Who is
this who even forgives sins?” Then He said to the woman, “Your faith has
saved you. Go in peace.”

Epistle. Romans 8:28-39.

And we know that all things work together for good to those who love
God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. For whom He
foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son,
that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom
He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justi-
fied: and whom He justified, these He also glorified, What then shall we
say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not
spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with
Him also freely give us all things? Who shall bring a charge against God’s
elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who
432

died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God,
who also makes intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love
of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or na-
kedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written: “For Your sake we are killed
all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” Yet in all these
things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am
persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor
powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor
any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Him with her sons, kneeling
down and asking something from Him. And He said to her, “What do you
wish?” She said to Him, “Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one
on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom.” But Jesus
answered and said, “You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink
the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I
am baptized with?” They said to Him, “We are able.” So He said to them,
“you will indeed drink My cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I
am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine
to give, but it is for those for whom it is prepared by My Father.” And
when the ten heard it, they were greatly displeased with the two broth-
ers. But Jesus called them to Himself and said, “You know that the rulers
of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise au-
thority over them. Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires
to become great among you, let him be your servant. And whoever de-
sires to be first among you, let him be your slave—just as the Son of Man
did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for
433

many.” Now as they went out of Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.
And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Je-
sus was passing by, cried out, saying, “Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of
David!” Then the multitude warned them that they should be quiet; but
they cried out all the more, saying, “Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of Da-
vid!” So jesus stood still and called them, and said, “What do you want Me
to do for you?” They said to Him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.”

For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in pris-

her. Because John had said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have
your brother’s wife.” Therefore Herodias held it against him and wanted
to kill him, but she could not; for Herod feared John, knowing that he
was a just and holy man, and he protected him. And when he heard him,
he did many things, and heard him gladly. Then an opportune day came
when Herod on his birthday gave a feast for his nobles, the high officers,
and the chief men of Galilee. And when Herodias’ daughter herself came
in and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king
said to the girl, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.” He
also swore to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half my
kingdom.” So she went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?”
And she said, “The head of John the Baptist!” Immediately she came in
with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once
the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” And the king was exceedingly
sorry; yet, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he
did not want to refuse her. Immediately the king sent an executioner and
commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in
prison, brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl
gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took

verted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the king-
dom of heaven. Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is
the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever receives one little child
like this in My name receives Me. But whoever causes one of these little

cast it from you, It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather
than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire. Take heed that you do not
despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels
always see the face of My Father who is in heaven. For the Son of Man has
come to save that which was lost.”

sheep for the slaughter.” Yet in all these things we are more than con-

nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor
things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be
able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

After these things the Lord appointed seventy others also, and sent them

laborers are few; therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out labor-
ers into His harvest. Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs among
wolves. Carry neither money bag, knapsack, nor sandals; and greet no
one along the road, But whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace to this
house.’ And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on it; if not, it
will return to you. And remain in the same house, eating and drinking
such things as they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not
go from house to house. Whatever city you enter, and they receive you,
eat such things as are set before you. And heal the sick there, and say to

it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, saying, “Do not harm the
earth, the sea, or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God
on their foreheads.” And I heard the number of those who were sealed.
One hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of
Israel were sealed: 5 of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed:
of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad
twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were
sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe
of Manasseh twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Simeon twelve
thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand were sealed;
of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Zebu-
lun twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand
were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed. After
these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could
number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the
throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branch-
es in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation be-
longs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” All the angels
stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and
fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, saying: ‘Amen!
Blessing and glory and wisdom, Thanksgiving and honor and power and
might, Be to our God forever and ever. Amen.” Then one of the elders an-
swered, saying to me, “Who are these arrayed in white robes, and where
did they come from?” And I said to him, “Sir, you know.” So he said to me,
“These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and washed
their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore they
are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple.
And He who sits on the throne will dwell among them. They shall neither
hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor

Then He said: “A certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said
to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.’ So he
divided to them his livelihood. And not many days after, the younger son
gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his
possessions with prodigal living. But when he had spent all, there arose
a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in want. Then he went
and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his
fields to feed swine. And he would gladly have filled his stomach with
the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him anything. But when he
came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have
bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go
to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven
and before you, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make
me like one of your hired servants.” ’ And he arose and came to his father.
But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had com-
passion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said to
him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no
longer worthy to be called your son.’ But the father said to his servants,
‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and
462

sandals on his feet. And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat
and be merry; for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and
is found.’ And they began to be merry. Now his older son was in the field.
And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing,
So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. And
he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and because he has received him
safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.’ But he was angry
and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him.
So he answered and said to his father, ‘Lo, these many years I have been
serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and
yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my
friends, But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your
livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.’ And he said to
him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours. It was right
that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is
alive again, and was lost and is found.”

keep him in perfect peace, Whose mind is stayed on You, Because he
trusts in You, Trust in the Lord forever, For in Yah, the Lord, is everlast-
ing strength. For He brings down those who dwell on high, The lofty city;
He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He brings it down to the dust.

The foot shall tread it down—The feet of the poor And the steps of the
needy.” The way of the just is uprightness; O Most Upright, You weigh
the path of the just. Yes, in the way of Your judgments, O Lord, we have
waited for You; The desire of our soul is for Your name And for the re-
membrance of You. With my soul I have desired You in the night, Yes, by
my spirit within me I will seek You early; For when Your judgments are
in the earth, The inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. Let
grace be shown to the wicked, Yet he will not learn righteousness: In the
land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, And will not behold the majesty
of the Lord. Lord, when Your hand is lifted up, they will not see. But they
will see and be ashamed For their envy of people; Yes, the fire of Your
enemies shall devour them. Lord, You will establish peace for us, For You
have also done all our works in us.

Lesson. 1 Timothy 2:1-8.

Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions,
and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in
authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and
reverence. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the
truth. For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the
Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due
time, for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am speaking
the truth in Christ and not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
truth. I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy
hands, without wrath and doubting;
