Stir up, we beseech Thee, Thy power, O Lord, and come, that by Thy pro- tection we may be rescued 
from the threatening perils of our sins, and saved by Thy mighty deliverance; who livest and

Epistle. Romans 13:11-14
And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our 
salvation is nearer than when we first believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand. 
Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of llght. Let us walk 
properly, as in the day, not in revelry arid drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in strife 
and envy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its 
lusts.

The Gospel. Matthew Zl:1-9
Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent 
two disciples, saying to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a 
donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them arid bring them to Me. And if anyone says any- thing 
to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of them,’ and immediately he will send them.” All this 
was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: “Tell the daughter of 
Zion, ‘Behold, your King is coming to you, Lowly, and sitting on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a 
donkey.’ ” 5o the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. They brought the donkey and the 
colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them. And a very great multitude spread their 
clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Then the 
multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: “Hosanna to the Son of David! 
‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ Hosanna in the highest!”

Epistle and Gospel Collects
(Ep.)  Merciful God and Father, we thank Thee that Thou hast caused the Sun of Righteousness to 
rise upon those that dwelt in darkness; and we beseech Thee, graciously break the power of darkness 
in our hearts, that we may continually increase in the knowledge of Thy truth, and serve Thee in 
righteousness and true holiness, through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, who liveth, etc.
(G.)   Awaken us, Lord God, that we may be ready when Thy Son cometh to receive Him with gladness 
and serve Thee with a pure heart, through the same Thy Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, who liveth,

Epistle. Romans 15:4—13
For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience 
and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to 
be like- minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus, that you may with one mind and one 
mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore receive one another, just as 
Christ also received us, to the glory of God. Now I say that Jesus Christ has become a servant to 
the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fa- thers, and that the 
Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy, as it is writ- ten: “For this reason 1 will confess to 
You among the Gentiles, And sing to Your name.” And again he says: “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His 
people!” And again: “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles! Laud Him, all you peoples!” And again, 
Isaiah says: “There shall be a root of Jesse; And He who shall



189

rise to reign over the Gentiles, In Him the Gentiles shall hope.” Now may the God of hope fill you 
with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Gospel. St. Luke 2i:25—36
“And there will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of 
nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them from fear and 
the expectation of those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens will 
be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. Now when 
these things begin to happen, look tip and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.” 
Then He spoke to them a parable: “Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. When they are already 
budding, you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near. So you also, when you see these 
things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. Assuredly, I say to you, this generation 
will by no means pass away till all things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My 
words will by no means pass away. “But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down 
with carousing, drunken- ness, and cares of this life, and that Day come on you unexpectedly. For 
it will come as a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth. batch therefore, and 
pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and 
to stand before the Son of Man.”

Epistle and Gospel Collects.
(Ep.)  O almighty God, who hast knit together Thine elect in one com- munion and fellowship in the

ChFlSt, Thy Son, our Lord, who liveth, etc.
(G.)  Cleanse our conscience, we beseech Thee, almighty God, by the daily visitation of Thy grace, 
that, when Thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, shall come, He may find us fit for His appearing, and 
ready to meet Him without spot, in the company of all His saints; who liveth, etc.

Epistle. 1 Corinthians 4:1—5.
Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mys- teries of God. Moreover it 
is required in stewards that one be found faith- ful. But with me it is a very small thing that I 
should be judged by you or by a human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. For I know of 
noth- ing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is





the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to 
light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each one's praise 
will come from God.

Gospel. Matthew 11:2-10.
And when John had heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said 
to Him, “Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?”Jesus answered and said to them, “Go 
and tellJohn the things which you hear and see: The blind see and the lame walk; the lep- ers are 
cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them. 
And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.” As they departed, Jesus began to say to the 
multitudes concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the 
wind? But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft 
clothing are in kings’ houses. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and 
more than a prophet. For this is he of whom it is written: ‘Behold, I send My messen- ger before 
Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.”’

Epistle and Gospel Collects.
(Ep.)  O LordJesus ChrlSt, who at Thy first coming dldst sendThy messenger to prepare Thy way

Thy second coming, to judge the world, we may be found an acceptable people in Thy sight, who 
livest, etc.
(G.)   O gracious and merciful Lord Jesus Christ, who by countless signs and wonders hast shown 
Thyself to be the true Messiah that was to come in whom alone we should trust and not look for 
another, we give Thee thanks for the true knowledge of Thee from Thy comforting Gospel, and

beseech Thee, keep us steadfast in Thy Word, lest, being offended in Thee, we be led by worldly

Now it shall come to pass in the latter days That the mountain of the Lord's house Shall be 
established on the top of the mountains, And shall be exalted above the hills; And all nations 
shall flow to it. Many people shall come and say, “Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
Lord, To the house of the God of Jacob; He will teach us His ways, And we shall walk in His paths.” 
For out of Zion shall go forth the law, And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall judge 
between the nations, And rebuke many people; They shall beat their swords into plowshares, And

spears into pruning hooks; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, Neither shall they learn 
war anymore. O house of Jacob, come and let us walk In the light of the Lord.

Gospel. St. Luke 1:26—38.
Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a 
virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary. 
And having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; 
blessed are you among women!” But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and considered 
what manner of greeting this was. Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have 
found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall 
call His name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God 
will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, 
and of His kingdom there will be no end.” Then Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, slnce I do 
not know a man?” And the angel answered and said to her, “The Holy 5pirit will come upon you, and 
the power of the High- est will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born 
will be called the Son of God. Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her 
old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren. For Wlth God nothing will 
be impossible.” Then Mary said, “Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to 
your word.” And the angel departed from her.

of the Lord, And He shall not judge by the sight of His eyes, Nor decide by the hearing of His 
ears; But with righteousness He shall judge the poor, And decide with equity for the meek of the

Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah, and

greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spir- 
it. Then she spoke omit with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is 
the fruit of your womb! But why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to 
me? For indeed, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my 
womb for joy. Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of those things which 
were told her from the Lord.” And Mary said: “My soul magnifies the Lord, And my spirit has 
rejoiced in God my Savior.”

Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we 
ask you, not to be soon shaken in mind or



196

troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had 
come. Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes 
first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perditiori, who opposes and exalts himself above 
all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing 
himself that he is God. Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? 
And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time. For the mystery of 
lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains will do so un- til He is taken out of the 
way. And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His 
mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming.

Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea,

of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. And he went into all the region around 
the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, as it is written in the 
book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 
‘Prepare the way of the Lord; Make His paths straight. Every valley shall be filled And every 
mountain and hill brought low; The crooked places shall be made straight Arid the rough ways 
smooth; And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”’

Gospel.John 1:19—28.
Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask 
him, “Who are you?” He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” And they 
asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he 
answered, “No.” Then they said to him, “Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent 
us? What do you say about yourself?” He said: “I am ‘The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 
“Make straight the way of the Lord,” ’ as the prophet Isaiah said.” Now those who were sent were 
from the Pharisees. And they asked him, saying, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, 
nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” John an- swered them, saying, “I baptize with water, but there stands 
One among you whom you do not know. It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose 
sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.” These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, 
where J   was baptizing.

Epistle. Hebrews 1:1—12.
God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 
has in these last days spoken to us by His 5on, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through 
whom also He made the worlds; who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His 
person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, 
sat down at the right hand of the Maj- esty on high, having become so much better than the angels, 
as He has by





inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. For to which of the angels did He ever 5ay: 
“You are My Son, Today I have begotten You”? And again: “I will be to Him a Father, And He shall be 
to Me a Son”? But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: “Let all the angels 
of God worship Him.” And of the angels He says: “Who makes His angels spirits And His ministers a 
flame of fire.” But to the Son He says: “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of 
rlghteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; 
Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.” And: 
“You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your 
hands. They will perish, but You remain; And they will all grow old like a garment; Like a cloak 
You will fold them up, And they will be changed. But You are the same, And Your years will not 
fail.”

Gospel. John 1:l—14.
In the beginning was the Word, arid the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the 
beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was 
made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and 
the darkness did not comprehend it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man 
came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. He was not 
that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light which gives light 
to every man coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and 
the world did not know Him. He came to His own, arid His own did not receive Him. But as many as 
received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His 
name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the





flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we 
beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begot- ten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

Isaiah9:2-7.
The people who walked in darkness Have seen a great light; Those who dwelt in the land of the 
shadow of death, Upon them a light has shined. You have multiplied the nation And increased its 
joy; They rejoice before You According to the joy of harvest, As men rejoice when they divide the 
spoil. £-or You have broken the yoke of his burden And the staff of his shoulder, The rod of his 
oppressor, As in the day of Midian. For every warrior's sandal from the noisy battle, And garments 
rolled in blood, Will be used for burning and fuel of fire. For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a 
Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, 
Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Fa- ther, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and 
peace There will be no end, Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, To or- der it and 
establish it with judgment and justice From that time forward, even forever. The zeal of the Lord 
of hosts will perform this.

And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world 
should be registered. This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria So all went 
to be registered, everyone to his own city.Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of 
Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house 
and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child. So it 
was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. And she brought 
forth her firstborn Son,





and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them 
in the inn. Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch 
over their flock by night. And behold, ari angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of 
the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid. Then the angel said to them, “Do not be 
afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. For there is 
born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be the 
sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.”

Epistle. GalaGans 4:1-7.
Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he 
is master of all, but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. Even 
so we, when we were chil- dren, were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the 
fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to 
redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. And because you 
are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba, Fa- ther!” 
Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken of Him. Then Simeon blessed 
them, and said to Mary His mother, “Be- hold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of 
many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against (yes, a sword will pierce through your 
own soul also), that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed” Now there was one, Arina, a 
prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe ofAsher. She was of a great age, and had lived 
with a husband seven years from her virginity; and this woman was a widow of about eighty-four 
years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with Hastings and prayers night and day. 
And coming in that instant she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of Him to all those who looked 
for redemption in



30S

Jerusalem. So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to 
Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with 
wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.

Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some 
strange thing happened to you; but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ's sufferings, 
that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. If you are reproached for 
the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their 
part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, 
a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people's matters. Set if anyone suffers as a 
Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter. For the time has come 
for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of 
those who do not obey the gospel of God? Now “If the righteous one is scarcely saved, Where will 
the ungodly and the sinner appear?” Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God 
commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.

Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, 
“Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there tintil I bring you word; 
for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.” When he arose, he took the young Child and His 
mother by night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be 
fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt 1 called My Son.” 
Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly an- gry; and he sent 
forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from 
two years old and under, ac- cording to the time which he had determined from the wise men. Then 
was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: “A voice was heard in Ramah, 
Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, Refusing to be 
comforted, Because they are no more.” Now when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord 
appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, “Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go 
to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young Child's life are dead.” Then he arose, took 
the young Child and His moth- er, and came into the land of Israel. But when he heard that 
Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being 
warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the re- gion of Galilee. And he came and dwelt in a 
city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, “He shall be 
called a Nazarene.”

Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from 
the East came to Jerusalem, saying, “Where is He who has been born King of theJews? For we have 
seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.” When Herod the king heard this, he was 
troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of 
the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. So they said to him, “ln 
Bethlehem ofJu- dea, for thus it is written by the prophet: ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of 
Judah, Are not the least among the rulers of Judah; For out of you shall come a Ruler Who will 
shepherd My people Israel.’ ” Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from 
them what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully 
for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and 
worship Him also.” When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had 
seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was. When they 
saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. And when they had come into the house, they 
saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened 
their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frarikincense, and myrrh. Then, being divinely 
warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another 
way.

His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. And when He was twelve years

days, as they returned, the BoyJesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did 
not know it; but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day's journey, and sought 
Him among their relatives and ac- quaintances. So when they did not find Him, they returned to 
Jerusalem, seeking Him. Now so it was that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting 
in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard 
Him were astonished at His understanding and answers. So when they saw Him, they were amazed; and 
His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You done this to us? Look, Your father and I have sought You 
anxiously.” And He said to them, “Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be about My 
Father's business?” But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them. Then He went

On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Now 
both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding. And when they ran out of wine, the mother 
of Jesus said to Him,



214

‘They have no wine.”Jesus Said to her, “Woman, what does your cor+cern have to do with Me? My hour 
has not yet come.” His mother said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do it.” Now there 
were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of purification of the Jews, 
containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece. Jesus said to them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” 
And they filled them up to the brim. And He said to them, “Draw some out now, and take it to the 
master of the feast.” And they took it. When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was 
made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the 
master of the feast called the bride- groom. And he said to him, “Every man at the beginning sets 
out the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good 
wine until now!” This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; 
and His disciples believed in Him.

Epistle. Romans 12:16-21.
Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the 
humble. Do not be wise in your own opin- ion. Repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good 
things in the sight of all men. If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with 
all men. Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, 
“Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,” says the Lord. Therefore “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; If 
he is thirsty, give him a drink; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.” Do not 
be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

Gospel. Matthew 8:1-13.
When He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. And behold, a leper came 
and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” Then Jesus put out 
His hand and touched him, saying, “1 am willing; be cleansed.” Immediately his leprosy was 
cleansed. And Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the 
priest, and offer the gift that Moses command- ed, as a testimony to them.” Now when Jesus had 
entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him, saying, “Lord, my servant is lying 
at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented” And Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.” The 
centurion answered and said, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only 
speak a word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man under authority, hav- ing soldiers 
under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to an- other, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to 
my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who 
followed, “As- suredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even iri Israel! And 1 
say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, andJacob in 
the kingdom of heaven. But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will 
be weeping and quashing of teeth.” Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way; and as you have 
believed, so let it be done for you.” And his servant was healed that same hour.

Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good

way. But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also ap- peared. So the 
servants of the owner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then 
does it have tares?' He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The servants said to him, ‘Do you 
want us then to go and gather them up?’ But he said, ‘No, lest while you gather up the tares you 
also uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of 
harvest 1 will say to the reapers, “First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to 
burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.””’

Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, andJohn his brother, led them up on a high mountain by

became as white as the light. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. Then 
Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make 
here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” While he was still 
speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, 
saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!” And when the disciples heard 
it, they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid. But Jesus came and touched them and said, 
“Arise, and do not be afraid.” When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only. 
Now as they came down from the moiintain,Jesus commanded them, saylng, “Tell the vision to no one 
until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.”

“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers 
for his vineyard. Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into 
his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, 
and said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they 
went. Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise. And about the 
eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, ‘Why have you been 
standing here idle all day?’ They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You 
also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.’ So when evening had come, the 
owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and give them their wages, beginning 
with the last to the first.’ And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each 
received a denarius. But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they 
likewise received each a denarius. And when they had received it, they complained against the 
landowner, saying, these last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have 
borne the burden and the heat of the day.’ But he answered one of them and said, ‘Friend, 1 am 
doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what is yours and go your way. 1 
wish to give to this last man the same as to you. Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my 
own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?’ So the last will be first, and the first last. 
For many are called, but few chosen.”

Epistle. 2 Corinthians 11:19—12:9.
For you put up with fools gladly, since you yourselves are wise! For you put up with it if one 
brings you into bondage, if one devours you, if one takes from you, if one exalts himself, if one 
strikes you on the face. To our shame I say that we were too weak for that! But in whatever anyone 
is bold—I speak foolishly—1 am bold also. Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Is- raelites? So am 
I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I. Are they minis- ters of Christ?—1 speak as a fool—I am 
more: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths 
often. From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one. Three times I was beaten with 
rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day 1have been in the deep; 
in journeys often, in perils of wa- ters, in perils of robbers, in perils of my own countrymen, in 
perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, 
in perils among false brethren; in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and 
thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness—be- sides the other things, what comes upon me 
daily: my deep concern for all the churches. Who is weak, and 1 am not weak? Who is made to 
stumble, and I do not burn with indignation? If 1 must boast, I will boast in the things which 
concern my infirmity. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows 
that I am not lying. In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city of the 
Damascenes with a gar- rison, desiring to arrest me; but I was let down in a basket through a 
window in the wall, and escaped from his hands. It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I 
will come to visions and revelations of the Lord: I know a man in Christ who fourteen years 
ago—whether in the body 1 do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a 
one was caught up to the third heaven. And I know such a man—whether in the body or out of the body 
I do not know, God knows—how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it 
is not lawful for a man to utter. Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not boast, 
except in my infirmi- ties. For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will 
speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears 
from me. And lest 1 should be exalted above mea- sure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn 
in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. 
Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. And He said 
to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for



227

My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my 
infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

Gospel. Luke 8:4-15.
And when a great multitude had gathered, and they had come to Him from every city, He spoke by a 
parable: “A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was 
trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it. Some fell on rock; and as soon as it sprang 
up, it withered away because it lacked moisture. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang 
up with it and choked it. But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and yielded a crop a 
hundredfold.” When He had said these things He cried, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!” Then 
His disciples asked Him, saying, “What does this parable mean?” And He said, “To you it has been 
given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is given in parables, that 
‘Seeing they may not see, And hearing they may not understand.' Now the parable is this: The seed 
is the word of God. Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away 
the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. But the ones on the rock are 
those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a 
while and in time of temptation fall away. Now the ones that fell among thorns are those who, when 
they have heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no 
fruit to maturity. But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word 
with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience.”

Epistle. 1 Corinthians 13:1—13.
Though 1 speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding 
brass or a clanging cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries 
and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not 
love, 1 am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I glve my body to 
be burned, but have not love, 1t profits me nothing. Love suffers lorig and is kind; love does not 
envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, 
is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but re- joices in the truth; bears 
all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. But 
whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether 
there is knowledge, it will vanish away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that 
which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away. When I was a child, I 
spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put 
away child- ish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in 
part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; 
but the greatest of these is love.

Gospel. Luke 18:1-43.
Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all 
things that are written by the prophets concern- ing the Son of Man will be accomplished. For He 
will be delivered to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted arid spit upon. They will scourge 
Him and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again.” But they under- stood none of these 
things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken. Then 
it happened, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the road beg-





ging. And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it meant. So they told him that Jesus of 
Nazareth was passing by. And he cried out, saying, ‘Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” Then 
those who went before warned him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “Son of 
David, have mercy on me!” So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he 
had come near, He asked him, saying, “What do you want Me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, that I 
may receive my sight.” Then Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.” 
Arid immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when 
they saw it, gave praise to God.

gracious and merciful, Slow to anger, and of great kindness; And He relents from doing harm. Who 
knows if He will turn and relent, And leave a blessing behind Him—A grain offering and a dririk 
offering F-or the Lord your God? Blow the trumpet in Zion, Con- secrate a fast, Call a sacred 
assembly; Gather the people, Sanctify the congre- gation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children 
and nursing babes; Let the bridegroom go out from his chamber, And the bride from her dressing 
room. Let the priests, who minister to the Lord, Weep between the porch and the





altar; Let them say, “Spare Your people, O Lord, And do not give Your heri- tage to reproach, That 
the nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’ 
”Then the Lord will be zealous for His land, And pity His people. The Lord will answer and say to 
His people, “Behold, 1 will send you grain and new wine and oil, And you will be satis- fied by 
them; I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.”

“Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad coun- tenance. For they

their reward. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not 
appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who 
sees in secret will reward you openly. Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth

Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. And when He had 
fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry. Now when the tempter came to Him, he 
said, “If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.” But He answered and 
said, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that pro- ceeds from 
the mouth of God.’ ”Then the devil took Hlm up into the holy city, set Him on the pinnacle of the 
temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: ‘He 
shall give His angels charge over you,’ and, ‘In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash 
your foot against a stone.’ ”Jesus said to him, “It is written again, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord 
your God.’ ” Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the 
kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him, “All these things I will give You if You 
will fall down and worship me.”ThenJesus said to him, “Away with you, Satari! For it is written, 
‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.’ ” Then the devil left Him, and 
behold, angels came and ministered to Him.

Then the Lord said to Moses, “Come up to Me on the mountain and be there; and I will give you 
tablets of stone, and the law and command- ments which I have written, that you may teach them.” So 
Moses arose with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up to the mountain of God. And he said to the 
elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. Indeed, Aaron and Hur are with you. If any man 
has a difficulty, let him go to them.” Then Moses went up into the mountain, and a cloud covered 
the mountain. Now the glory of the Lord rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. 
And on the seventh day He called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. The sight of the glory of 
the Lord was like a consum- ing fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of 
Israel. So

Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.” 
But He answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no 
sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days arid 
three nights in the belly of‘the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days arid three nights 
in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and 
condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is 
here. The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for 
she came from the ends of the earth to
hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed a greater than Solomon is here. When an unclean spirit goes 
out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none. Then he says, ‘I will 
return to my house from which I came.’ And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in 
order. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, arid they 
enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be 
with this wicked genera- tion.” While He was still talking to the multitudes, behold, His mother 
and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him. Then one said to Him, “Look, Your mother and 
Your brothers are standing outside, seek- ing to speak with You.” But He answered and said to the 
one who told Him, “Who is My mother and who are My brothers?” And He stretched out His hand toward 
His disciples and said, “Here are My mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of My Father 
in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.”

committed, keeps all My statutes, and does what is lawful and right, he shall surely live; he shall 
not die. None of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him; because 
of the righteousness which he has done, he shall live. Do I have any pleasure at all that the 
wicked should die?” says the Lord God, “and not that he should turn from his ways and live? But 
when a righteous man turns away from hls righteousness and commits iniquity, and does according to 
all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All the righteousness which he has 
done shall not be remembered; because of the unfaithfulness of which he is guilty and the sin which 
he has
committed, because of them he shall die. Yet you say, the way of the Lord is not fair.’ Hear now, O 
house of Israel, is it not My way which is fair, and





your ways which are not fair? When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits 
iniquity, and dies in it, it is because of the iniquity which he has done that he dies. Again, when 
a wicked man turns away from the wickedness which he committed, and does what Is lawful and £Jght, 
he preserves himself alive. Because he considers arid turns away from all the transgressions which 
he committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.

After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is in Jerusalem 
by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a 
great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water. For an 
angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in 
first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had. Now a certain man 
was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he 
already had been in that condition a long time, He said to him, “Do you want to be made well?” The 
sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; 
but while I am coming, another steps down before me.”Jesus said to him, “Rise, take up your bed and 
walk.” And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked. And that day was the 
Sabbath. The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you 
to carry your bed.” He answered them, “He who made me well said to me, ‘Take up your bed and 
walk.”’Then they asked him, “Who is the Man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?” But the 
one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had with- drawn, a multitude being in that 
place. AfterwardJesus found him in the temple, and said to him, “See, you have been made well. Sin 
no more, lest a worse thing come upon you.” The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus 
who had made him well.

was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” Then she came and worshiped Him, 
say- ing, “Lord, help me!” But He answered and said, “It is not good to take the children's bread 
and throw it to the little dogs.” And she said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs

whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. But if I cast out demons with 
the finger of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you. When a strong man, fully armed, 
guards his own palace, his goods are in peace. But when a stron- ger than he comes upon him and 
overcomes him, he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils. He who 
is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters. When an unclean spirit 
goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, ‘I will 
return to my house from which I came.’ And when he comes, he finds it swept and put in order. Then 
he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell 
there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.” And it happened, as He spoke these 
things, that a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, “Blessed is the womb 
that bore You, and the breasts which nursed You!” But He said, “More than that, blessed are those 
who hear the word of God and keep it!”

Epistle. Galatians 4:21—3i.
Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? For it is written that 
Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. But he who was of the 
bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, which things 
are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to 
bondage, which is Hagar—for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and cor- responds to Jerusalem 
which now is, and is in bondage with her children— but theJerusalem above is free, which is the 
mother of us all. For it is written: “Rejoice, O barren, You who do not bearl Break forth and 
shout, You who are not in labor! For the desolate has many more children Than she who has a 
husband.” Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise. But, as he who was born 
according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now. 
Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the boridwomari and her son, for the son of the 
bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.” So then, brethren, we are not children 
of the bondwoman but of the free.

After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias. Then a great 
multitude followed Him, because they saw His signs which He performed on those who were diseased. 
And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples. Now the Pass- over, a feast 
of the Jews, was near. Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and see- ing a great multitude coming toward 
Him, He said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?” But this He said to test 
him, for He

Himself knew what He would do. Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not 
sufficient for them, that every one of them may have a little.” One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon 
Peter's broth- er, said to Him, “There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, 
but what are they among so many?” Then Jesus said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was much 
grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. And Jesus took the loaves, 
and when He had given thanks He distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those 
sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted. So when they were filled, He said 
to His disciples, “Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.” Therefore they 
gath- ered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which 
were left over by those who had eaten. Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, 
said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.” Therefore when Jesus perceived 
that they were about to come arid take Him by force to make Him king, He departed again to the 
mountain by Himself alone.

But Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the great- er and more perfect 
tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation. Not with the blood of goats and 
calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal 
re- demption. For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the 
unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who 
through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead 
works to serve the living clod? And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by 
means of death, for the redemption of the transgres- sions under the first covenant, that those who 
are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.

“ Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of 
God hears God's words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.” Then the Jews 
answered and said to Him, “Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?” Jesus 
answered, “I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. And I do not seek My 
own glory; there is One who seeks and judges. Most assuredly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word 
he shall never see death.” Then the Jews said to Him, “Now we know that You have a demon! Abraham 
is dead, and the prophets; and You say, ‘If any- one keeps My word he shall never taste death.’ Are 
You greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead. Who do You make 
Yourself out to be?”Jesus answered, “lf I honor Myself, My honor is nothlng. It is My Father who 
honors Me, of whom you say that He is your God. Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if 
I say, ‘I do not know Him,’ I shall be a liar like you; but I do know Him and keep His word. Your 
father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.” Then the Jews said to Him, “You 
are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?” Jesus said to them, “Most assuredly, I say 
to you, before Abraham was, I AM.” Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself 
and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.

bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled 
Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. There- fore God 
also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of 
Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the

Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, them Jesus sent

donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to Me. And if anyone says any- thing to 
you, you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of them,’ and immediately he will send them.” All this was 
done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: “Tell the daughter of 
Zion, ‘Behold, your King is coming to you, Lowly, arid sitting on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a 
donkey.’ ” So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. They brought the donkey and the 
colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them. And a very great multitude spread their 
clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Then the 
multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: “Hosanna to the Son of David! 
‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ Hosanna in the highest!”

Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, 
whom He had raised from the dead. There they made Him a supper; arid Martha served, but Lazarus was 
one of those who sat at the table with Him. Then Mary took a pound of very costly oil of spikenard, 
anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the 
fragrance of the oil. But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who would betray Him, 
said, “Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?” This he 
said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was


254

a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. But Jesus said, “Let her 
alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial. For the poor you have with you always, but Me 
you do not have always. Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not for 
Jesus’ sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. But the 
chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death also, because on account of him many of the Jews went 
away and believed in Jesus. The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they 
heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and 
cried out: “Hosanna! ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ The King of Israel!” 
ThenJesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written: “Fear not, daugh- ter of 
Zion; Behold, your King is coming, Sitting on a donkey's colt.” His disciples did not understand 
these things at first; but when Jesus was glo- rified, then they remembered that these things were 
written about Him and that they had done these things to Him. Therefore the people, who were with 
Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness. For this 
reason the people also met Him, be- cause they heard that He had done this sign. The Pharisees 
therefore said among themselves, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, the world has 
gone after Him!” Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast. 
Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, “sir, we wish 
to see Jesus.” Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus. But Jesus 
answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.

Most assuredly, Isay to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains 
alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain. He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates 
his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and 
where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor. Now My 
soul is troubled, and what shall 1 say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? But for this purpose I 
came to this hour. Father, glorify Your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, saying, “I have both 
glori- fied it and will glorify it again.” Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that 
it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to Him.” Jesus answered and said, “This voice 
did not come because of Me, but for your sake. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of 
this world will be cast out. And I, if 1 am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to 
Myself.” This He said, signifying by what death He would die. The people answered Him, “We have 
heard from the law that the Christ remains forever; and how can You say, ‘The Son of Man must be 
lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?” Then Jesus said to them, “A little while longer the light is 
with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you; he who walks in darkness does 
not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become 
sons of light.” These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and was hidden from them. But although He 
had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in Him, that the word of Isaiah the 
prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: “Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the 
arm of the Lord been revealed?” Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again: “He 
has blinded their eyes and hard- ened their hearts, Lest they should see with their eyes, Lest they 
should understand with their hearts and turn, So that 1 should heal them.” These things Isaiah said 
when he saw His glory and spoke of Him. Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in Him, 
but because of the Phari- sees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the syna- 
gogue; for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called Passover. And the chief priests and

surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered among the twelve. So he went his way and conferred with the 
chief priests and captains, how he might betray Him to them. And they were glad, and agreed to give 
him money. So he promised and sought opportunity to betray Him to them in the absence of the multi- 
tude. Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover must be killed. And He sent Peter 
and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Pass- over for us, that we may eat.” So they said to Him, 
“Where do You want us to prepare?” And He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered the city, a 
man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house which he enters. Then you 
shall say to the master of the house,





’The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?” 
’ Then he will show you a large, furnished upper room; there make ready.” So they went and found it 
just as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover. When the hour had come, He sat down, 
and the twelve apostles with Him. Then He said to them, “With fervent desire I have desired to eat 
this Passover with you before I suffer; for I say to you, I will no longer eat of it until it is 
fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, “Take this and 
divide it among yourselves; for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the 
kingdom of God comes.” And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, 
“This is My body WhlCh is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” Likewise He also took the 
cup after supper, saying, ‘this cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you. But 
behold, the hand of My betrayer is with Me on the table. And truly the Son of Man goes as it has 
been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!” Then they began to ques- tion among 
themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing. Now there was also a dispute among them, 
as to which of them should be considered the greatest. And He said to them, “The kings of the 
Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called 
‘benefactors.’ But not so among you; on the contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as 
the younger, and he who governs as he who serves. For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or 
he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves. But 
you are those who have continued with Me in My trials. And 1 bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My 
Father bestowed one upon Me, that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on 
thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has 
asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not 
fail; and when you have re- turned to Me, strengthen your brethren.” But he said to Him, “Lord, I 
am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death.” Then He said, “I tell you, Peter, the 
rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me.” And He said to 
them, “When I sent you without money bag, knapsack, and sandals, did you lack anything?” So they 
said, “Nothing.” Then He said to them, “But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and 
likewise a knapsack; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one. For I say to 
you that this which is written



360

must still be accomplished in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the trans- gressors.’ For the things 
concerning Me have an end.” So they said, “Lord, look, here are two swords.” And He said to them, 
“lt is enough.” Coming out, He went to the Mount of Olives, as He was accustomed, and His dis- 
ciples also followed Him. When He came to the place, He said to them, “Pray that you may not enter 
into temptation.” And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down arid 
prayed, saying, “£-ather, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, 
but Yours, be done.” Then an angel appeared to Him from heav- en, strengthening Him. And being in 
agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to 
the ground. When He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from 
sorrow. Then He said to them, “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.” 
And while He was still speaking, behold, a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the 
twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him. But Je- sus said to him, “Judas, are 
you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” When those around Him saw what was going to happen, they 
said to Him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” And one of them struck the ser- vant of the 
high priest and cut off his right ear. But Jesus answered and said, “Permit even this.” And He 
touched his ear and healed him. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and 
the elders who had come to Him, “Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs? 
When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not try to seize Me. But this is your hour, and 
the power of darkness.” Having ar- rested Him, they led Him and brought Him into the high priest's 
house. But Peter followed at a distance. Now when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the 
courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. 56 And a certain servant girl, seeing him as 
he sat by the fire, looked intent- ly at him and said, “This man was also with Him.” But he denied 
Him, saying, “Woman, I do not know Him.” And after a little while another saw him and said, “You 
also are of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!” Then after about an hour had passed, another 
confidently affirmed, say- ing, “Surely this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean.” But 
Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are saying!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, the 
booster crowed. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the 
Lord, how He had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” So Peter



361

went out and wept bitterly. Now the men who held Jesus mocked Him and beat Him. And having 
blindfolded Him, they struck Hlm On the face and asked Him, saying, “Prophesy! Who is the one who 
struck You?” And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him. As soon as it was day, the 
elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, 
saying, “If You are the Christ, tell us.” But He said to them, “If I tell you, you will by no means 
believe. And if I also ask you, you will by no means answer Me or let Me go. Hereafter the Son of 
Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.” Then they all said, “Are You then the Son of 
God?” So He said to them, “You rightly say that I am.” And they said, “What further testimony do we 
need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.” Then the whole multitude of them arose 
and led Him to Pilate. And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this fellow perverting the 
nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.” Then 
Pilate asked Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?” He answered him and said, “It is as you 
say.” So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no fault in this Man.” But they 
were the more fierce, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout allJiidea, beginning 
from Galilee to this place.” When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean. And 
as soon as he knew that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in 
Jerusalem at that time. Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a 
long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle 
done by Him. Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing. And the chief 
priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him. Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him 
with contempt and mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate. That 
very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity 
with each other. Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the 
people, said to them, “You have brought this Man to me, as one who misleads the people. And indeed, 
having examined Him in your presence, 1 have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of 
which you accuse Him; no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing 
deserving of death has been done by Him. I will therefore chas- tise Him and release Him” (for it 
was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast). And they all cried out at once, saying, 
“Away with this



263

Man, and release to us Barabbas”—who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in 
the city, and for murder. Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them. 
But they shouted, say- ing, “Crucify Him, crucify Him!” Then he said to them the third time, “Why, 
what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. 1 will therefore chastise Him and 
let Him go.” But they were insistent, de- manding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the 
voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed. So Pilate gave sentence that it should be 
as they requested. And he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had 
been thrown into prison; but he deliveredJesus to their will. Now as they led Him away, they laid 
hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyreriian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the 
cross that he might bear it afterJesus. And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women 
who also mourned and lamented Him. ButJesus, turning to them, said, “Daughters ofJerusalem, do not 
weep for Me, but weep for your- selves and for your children. For indeed the days are coming in 
which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts which never 
nursed!’ Then they will begin ‘to say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!” 
’ For if they do these things in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?” There were also two 
others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death. And when they had come to the place called 
Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the 
left. Then Jesus said, “Father, for- give them, for they do not know what they do.” And they 
divided His gar- ments and cast lots. And the people stood looking or. But even the rulers with 
them sneered, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of 
God.” The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine, and saying, “If You are the 
King of theJews, save Yourself.” And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, 
Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then one of the criminals who were hanged 
blasphemed Him, saying, “If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.” But the other, answering, 
rebuked him, say- ing, “Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemna- tion? And 
we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong.” 
Then he said to Jesus, “Lord, re- member me when You come into Your kingdom.”

Epistle. 1 Corinthians 11:23—32.
For I received from the Lord that which 1 also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same 
rnght in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, 
‘take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” In the same 
manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This 
do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”-or as often as you eat this bread and drink 
this cup, you pro- claim the Lord's death till He comes. Therefore whoever eats this bread or 
drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body arid blood of the 
Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he 
who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the 
Lord's body. For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and


364
many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged. But when we are judged, we are 
chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.

Gospel. John 13:1-15 or The History of the Passion.
Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart 
from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the 
end. And supper be- ing ended, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, 
Simon's son, to betray Him, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and 
that He had come from God and was going to God, rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took 
a towel and gird- ed Himself. After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the 
disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded. Then He came to Simon 
Peter. And Peter said to Him, “Lord, are You washing my feet?” Jesus answered and said to him, 
“What 1 am do- ing you do not understand now, but you will know after this.” Peter said to Him, 
“You shall never wash my feet!”Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with 
Me.” Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”Jesus said to 
him, “He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but 
not all of you.” For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, “You are not all clean.” So 
when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, “Do you 
know what 1 have done to you? You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I 
then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For 
I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.

Epistle. Isaiah 52:13—53:12.
Behold, My Servant shall deal prudently; He shall be exalted and extolled and be very high. Just as 
many were astonished at you, So His visage was marred more than any man, And His form more than the 
sons of men; So shall He sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths at Him; For what had 
riot been told them they shall see, And what they had not heard they shall consider. Who has 
believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? for He shall grow up before 
Him as a ten- der plant, And as a root out of dry ground. He has no form or comeliness; And when we 
see Him, There is no beauty that we should desire Him. He is despised and rejected by men, A Man of 
sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and 
we did not esteem Him. 4 Surely He has borne our griefs And carried our sorrows; Yet we esteemed 
Him stricken, Smitten by God, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was 
bruised for our iniq- uities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we 
are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way; And the 
Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He opened 
not His mouth; He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, And as a sheep before its shearers is silent, 
So He opened not His mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment, And who will declare His 
generation? For He was cut off from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He 
was stricken. And they made His grave with the wicked—But with the rich at His death, Because He 
had done no violence, Nor was any deceit in His mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He 
has put Him to grief. When You make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed, He shall 
prolong His days, And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand. He shall see the labor of 
His soul, and be satis- fied. By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many, For He 
shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great, And He shall 
divide the spoil with the strong, Because He poured out His



267

soul unto death, And He was numbered with the transgressors, And He bore the sin of many, And made 
intercession for the transgressors.

Gospel. John i8:1—19:42 or The History of the Passion.
When Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples over the Brook Kidron, where 
there was a garden, which He and His disciples entered. AndJudas, who betrayed Him, also knew the 
place; for Jesus often met there with His disciples. Then Judas, having received a detachment of 
troops, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and 
weapons. Jesus therefore, knowing all things that would come upon Him, went forward and said to 
them, “Whom are you seeking?” They answered Him, “Jesus of Nazareth.”Jesus said to them, “1 am He.” 
And Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them. Now when He said to them, “I am He,” they drew 
back and fell to the ground. Then He asked them again, “Whom are you seeking?” And they said, 
“Jesus of Naza- reth.”Jesus answered, “1 have told you that I am He. Therefore, if you seek Me, let 
these go their way,” that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, “Of those whom You gave Me 
I have lost none.” Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, 
and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. SoJesus said to Peter, “Put your sword 
into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My father has given Me?”
Then the detachment of troops and the captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound 
Him. And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was high 
priest that year. Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man 
should die for the people.



Z68

And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the 
high priest, and went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. But Peter stood at the door 
outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who 
kept the door, arid brought Peter in. Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, “You 
are not also one of this Man's disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.” Now the servants and 
officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold, and they warmed them- selves. 
And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.
The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doc- trine. Jesus answered him, “I 
spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always 
meet, and in se- cret I have said nothing. Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard Me what I 
said to them. Indeed they know what I said.” And when He had said these things, one of the officers 
who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, “Do You answer the high priest like 
that?” Jesus answered him, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do 
you strike Me?” Then Arinas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Therefore they said to him, “You are not also one of His 
disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not!” One of the servants of the high priest, a 
relative of him whose ear Peter cut off:, said, “Did I not see you in the garden with Him?” Peter 
then denied again; and immediately a roosted crowed.
Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. But they themselves 
did not go into the Praetorium, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover. 
Pilate then went out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this Man?” They 
answered and said to him, “If He were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him up to you.” 
Then Pilate said to them, “You take Him and judge Him according to your law.” Therefore the Jews 
said to him, “It is riot lawful for us to put anyone to death,” that the saying of Jesus might be 
fulfilled which He spoke, signifying by what death He would die. Then Pilate entered the Praetorium 
again, called Jesus, and said to Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” Jesus answered him, “Are you 
speaking for yourself about this, or did others tell you this concern- ing Me?” Pilate answered, 
“Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You 
done?”Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My



269

servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from 
here.” Pilate therefore said to Him, “Are You a king then?”Jesus answered, “You say rightly that I 
am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should 
bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.” Pilate said to Him, “What 
is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, “I find no 
fault in Him at all. “But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at
the Passover. Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” Then they all cried 
again, saying, “Not this Man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.
So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him. And the soldiers twist- ed a crown of thorns and put it 
on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe. Then they said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” And they 
struck Him with their hands. Pilate then went out again, and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing 
Him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in Him.”
Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, 
“Behold the Man!” Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, 
“Crucify Him, crucify Him!” Pilate said to them, “You take Him and CPtlClfy Him, for I find no 
fault in Him.” The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, 
because He made Himself the Son of God.” Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more 
afraid, and went again into the Praetorium, and said toJesus, “Where are You from?” ButJesus gave 
him no answer. Then Pilate said to Him, “Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have 
power to crucify You, and power to release You?”Jesus answered, “You could have no power at all 
against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered Me to you has 
the greater sin.” From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If 
you let this Man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against 
Caesar.” When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment 
seat in a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha Now it was the Preparation Day 
of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, “Behold your King!” But they 
cried out, “Away with Him, away with Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your 
King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!” Then he delivered Him to them to 
be crucified. Then they tookJesus and led Him away.





And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in 
Hebrew, Golgotha, where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus 
in the center. Now Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF 
NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus 
was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. Therefore the 
chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, “I 
am the King of the Jews.” ’ ” Pilate answered, “What I have written, 1 have written.” Then the 
soldiers, when they had crucifiedJesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a 
part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece. They 
said therefore among themselves, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be,” 
that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: “They divided My garments among them, And for My 
clothing they cast lots.” Therefore the soldiers did these things.
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, 
and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing 
by, He said to His mother, “Woman, behold your son!” Then He said to the disciple, “Behold your 
mother!” And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.
After this, Jesus, knowing that all thirigs were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be 
fulfilled, said, “I thirst!” Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and they filled a 
sponge with sour wine, put it on hyssop, and put it to His mouth. So when Jesus had received the 
sour wine, He said, “It is finished!” And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit. Therefore, 
because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath 
(for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that 
they might be taken away. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other 
who was crucified with Him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did 
not break His legs. But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immedi- ately blood 
arid water came out. And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows 
that he is telling the truth, so that you may believe. For these things were done that the 
Scripture should be fulfilled, “Not one of His bones shall be broken.” And again another
Scripture says, “They shall look on Him whom they pierced.”



271
After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but se- cretly, for fear of the Jews, 
asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came 
and took the body of Jesus. And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing 
a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound 
it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where 
He was cruci- fied there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been 
laid. So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews' Prepara- tion Day, for the tomb was nearby.

(Ep.)  O Lord, our 5avior, we praise and bless Thee that Thou wast obedient onto death, even the 
death of the cross, and, having finished all, art become our Mediator and Redeemer; and we beseech 
Thee, grant that by Thy death we may be crucified unto the world, and henceforth live not unto 
ourselves, but unto Thee, who didst die for us, and who livest and reignest, etc.
Merciful God, Heavenly Father, we give Thee most hearty thanks that Thou hast removed from us the 
grievous burden of our sins and placed it upon Thy dear Son, our Lord, Jesus Christ; and we humbly 
be- seech Thee, govern us by Thy Holy Spirit, that we may comfort ourselves with His suffering and 
death in the face of all temptation, diligently guard against sin and an evil conscience, and 
finally obtain eternal salvation; through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, who liveth, etc.
(G.)   Merciful God and Father, who didst give Thy Son into death and the grave for our sins, we 
beseech Thee, enable as also to die unto sin and to bury the lusts of the flesh, that our lives may 
be wholly in Christ, our death transformed by His death into sweet sleep, our graves hallowed by 
His rest in the grave, and we may finally rise again unto eternal joy; through Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, our Lord, who liveth, etc.
O righteous and holy God, who hast manifested toward us Thine unfathomable love in not sparing 
Thine own Son, but delivering Him up for us all: By the memory of His bitter death, by the awful 
mystery of His sorrows in the Garden and upon the cross, we humbly beseech Thee to have mercy upon 
us and upon all men, and to make known Thy saving health among the nations, that He may see of the 
travail of His soul and be satisfied; to whom, with Thee and the Holy Ghost, be honor and glory, 
world without end. Amen.

Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, 
that they might come and anoint Him. Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they 
came to the tomb when the sun had risen. And they said among themselves, “Who will roll away the 
stone from the door of the tomb for us?” But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been 
rolled away—for it was very large. And entering the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a long 
white robe sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed. But he said to them, “Do not be 
alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was cruci- fied. He is rises! He is not here. See the 
place where they laid Him. But go, tell His disciples—and Peter—that He is going before you into 
Galilee; there you will see Him, as He said to you.” So they went out quickly and fled from the 
tomb, for they trembled and were amazed. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

Gospel. Luke 24:IS—35.
Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was seven 
miles from Jerusalem. And they talked togeth- er of all these things which had happened. So it was, 
while they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus 1-himself drew near and sent with them. But their 
eyes were restrained, so that they did not krtow Him. And He said to them, What kind of 
conversation is this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?” Then the one whose 
name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, “Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and have You 
not known the things which happened there in these days?” And He said to them, “What things?” So 
they said to Him, “The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a Prophet mighty in deed and 
word before God and all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be 
condemned to death, and crucified Him. But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem 
Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened. Yes, and 
certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us. When they did not find 
His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive. And 
certain of those who were with us went to the tomb and found itjust as the women had said; but Him 
they did not see.” Then He said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that 
the prophets have spoken! Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His 
glory?” And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the 
things concerning Himself. Then they drew near to the village where they were going, and He 
indicated that He would have gone farther. But they con- strained Him, saying, “Abide with us, for 
it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.” And He went in to stay with them. Now it came to 
pass, as He sat at the table with them, that He took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to 
them. Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him; and He vanished from their sight. And they 
said to one another, “Did not our heart burn wlthin us while He talked with us on the road, and 
while He opened the Scriptures to us?” So they rose up that very hour and re- turned to Jerusalem, 
and found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, saying,"The Lord is risen 
indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” And they told about the things that had happened on the road, 
and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.

Epistle. 1John 5:4-12.
For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the 
world—our faith. Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of 
God? This is He who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and 
blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth. For there are three 
that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one. 
And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these 
three agree as one. If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God
is greater; for this is the witness of God whlch He has testified of His Son.
He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself; he who does not believe God has made 
Him a liar, because he has not believed the tes- timony that God has given of His Son. And this is 
the testimony: that God





has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does 
not have the Son of God does not have life.

Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the 
disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came arid stood in the midst, and sad to 
them, “Peace be with you” When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the 
dis- ciples were glad when they saw the Lord. SoJesus said to them again, “l°eace to you! As the 
Father has sent Me, I also send you.” And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to 
them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you 
retain the sins of any, they are retained.” Now Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not 
with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said to him, “We have seen the Lord.” So 
he said to them, “Unless 1 see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the 
print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, 1 will not believe.” And after eight days His 
disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shot, and stood in 
the midst, and said, “Peace to you!” Then He said to Thomas, “Reach your finger here, and look at 
My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My slde. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.” 
And Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!”Jesus said to him, “Thomas, because you 
have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” And 
truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this 
book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that 
believing you may have life in His name.

Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as 
supreme, or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punish- ment of evildoers and for 
the praise of those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to

bondservants of God Honor all people. Love the brotherhood.FearGoñ Honor the king. Servants, be 
submissive toyour masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh. 
For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering 
wrongfully. For what credit is it if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? 
But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this is commendable before God

“A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I

us, ‘A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me”, and, 
‘because I go to the F-ather’?” They said therefore, “What is this that He says, ‘A little while’? 
We do not know what He is saying.” Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to 
them, “Are you inquiring among yourselves about what I said, ‘A little while, and you will not see 
Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me’? Most assuredly, I say to you that you will weep 
and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned 
into joy. A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she 
has given birth to the chtld, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has 
been born into the world. Therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart 
will rejoice, and your





joy no one will take from you. And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to 
you, whatever you ask the £-ather in My name He will give you.”

own will He brought us forth by I:he word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His 
crea- tures. So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swifi to hear, slow to speak, slow to 
wrath; for the wrath of man does not produce the righteous- ness of God. Therefore lay aside all 
filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able 
to save your souls.

“But now I go away to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’ But because 
I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth. 
It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; 
but if I depart, I will send Him to you. And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, 
and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe in Me; of righteousness, 
because 1 go to My Father arid you see Me no more; of judgment, because the ruler of this world is 
judged. I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. However, when He, the 
Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own 
authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. He will 
glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. All things that

the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you.

Epistle. James 1:22—27.
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of 
the word and not a doer, he is like a man observ- ing his natural face in a mirror; for he observes 
himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. But he who looks into the 
perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, 
this one will be blessed in what he does. If any- one among you thinks he is religious, and does 
not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one's religion is useless. Pure and 
undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, 
and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.

Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The

And He said to them, “Which of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight and say to him, 
‘Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine has come to me on his journey, and I have 
nothing to set before him”, and he will answer from within and say, ‘Do not trouble me; the door is 
now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give to you’? I say to you, though 
he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will 
rise and give him as many as he needs. So 1 say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and 
you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who





asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. If a son asks for 
bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give 
him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he asks for an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If you 
thert, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly

Epistle. Acts 1:1—H.
The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, until the 
day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the 
apostles whom He had chosen, to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many 
infal- lible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to 
the kingdom of God And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart 
Tom]erufalem, but to wait for the Prom- ise of the Father, “which,” He said, “you have heard kom 
Me; for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many 
days from now.” Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, “Lord, will You at 
this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” And He sald to them, “It is not for you to know times or 
seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy 
Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and 
Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He 
was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward 
heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, who also said, “Men of 
Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into 
heaven, will so come in like mariner as you saw Him go into heaven.”

Later He appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and He rebuked their unbelief and 
hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Hlm after He had risen. And He 
said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and 
is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will 
follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; 
they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they 
will lay hands on





the sick, and they will recover.” So then, after the Lord had spoken to them,
He was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went out and 
preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word through the accompanying 
signs. Amen.

When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly

they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each 
of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as 
the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every 
nation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, 
because everyone heard them speak in his one language. Then they were all amazed and marveled, 
saying to one another, “Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? And how is it that we hear, 
each in our own language in which we were born? Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in 
Mesopotamia,Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Ph- rygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of 
Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—we hear

poured out on the Gentiles also. For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter

believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of 
God. And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness 
rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and 
does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to

you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. But this is what was spoken by the prophet 
Joel: ‘And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That 1 will pour out of My Spirit on 
all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall proph- esy, Your young men shall see visions, Your 
old men shall dream dreams. And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit 
in those days; And they shall prophesy. I will show wonders in heaven above And signs in the earth 
beneath: Blood and fire and vapor of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon 
into blood, Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord. And it shall come to pass 
That whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”’

“No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last 
day. It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’ Therefore everyone who 
has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me. Not that anyone has seen the Father, ex- cept He 
who is from God; He has seen the Father. Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has 
everlasting life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and are 
dead. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.





I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live 
forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the 
world.” The Jews therefore quarreled among themselves, saying, “How can this Man give us His flesh 
to eat?”

Now it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Ph&f1sees and teachers of the 
law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of 
the Lord was present to heal them. Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom 
they sought to bring in and lay before Him. And when they could not find how they might bring him 
in, because of the crowd, they went up on the housetop and let him down with his bed through the 
tiling into the midst before Jesus. When He saw their faith, He said to him, “Man, your sins are 
forgiven you.” And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks 
blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, He 
answered and said to them, “Why are you reasoning in your hearts? Which is easier, to say, ‘Your 
sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise up and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of Man 
has power on earth to forgive sins”—He said to the man who was paralyzed, “1 say to you, arise, 
take up your bed, and go to your house.” Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had 
been lying on, and departed to his or house, glorifying God. And they were all amazed, and they 
glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today!”

There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by 
night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do 
these signs that You do unless God is with him.”Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assur- edly, 
I say to you, unless one is born again, he carinot see the kingdom of God.” Nicodemus said to Him, 
“How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be 
born?”Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he 
cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born 
of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ The wind blows 
where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where lt comes from and where it 
goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Nicodemus answered and said to Him, “How can these 
things be?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these 
things? Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and you 
do not receive Our witness. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you 
believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from 
heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the 
wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not 
perish but have eternal life.

but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made 
perfect in love. We love Him because He first loved us. If someone says, “I love God,” and hates

"There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every

desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. Moreover the dogs came and 
licked his sores. So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. 
The rich man also died and was buried. And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and 
saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. “Then he cried and said, ‘Father Abraham, have 
mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; 
for I am tormented in this flame.’ But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you 
received your good things, and like- wise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are 
tormented. And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who 
want to pass from here to you carinot, nor can those from there pass to us.’ Then he said, ‘I beg 
you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house, for I have five brothers, that 
he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.’ Abraham said to him, they 
have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.’ And he said, ‘No, father Abraham; but if one goes 
to them from the dead, they will repent.’ But he said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the 
prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead.’ ”

I must go and see it. I ask you to have me excused.’ And an- other said, ‘I have bought five yoke 
of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused.’ Still another said, ‘I have 
married a wife, and therefore 1 cannot come.’ So that servant came and reported these things to his 
master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the 
streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the lame and the 
blind.’ And the servant said, ‘Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.’ Then

not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? 
And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoul- ders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he 
calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my 
sheep which was lost!’ I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner 
who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance. Or what woman, having ten 
silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search care- fully

For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the 
glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for 
the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but 
because of Him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself also will be delivered from 
the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the 
whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now. Not only that, but we also 
who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, ea- gerly waiting

Finally, all of you be of one mind, having compassion for one another; love as brothers, be 
tenderhearted, be courteous; not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the 
contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing. For “He 
who would love life And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips from 
speaking deceit. Let him turn away from evil and do good; Let him seek peace and pursue it. For the 
eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, And His ears are open to their prayers; But the face of the 
Lord is against those who do evil.” And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what 
is good? But even if you should suffer for righ- teousness' sake, you are blessed. “And do not be 
afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.” But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be 
ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, wlth 
meekness and fear;

So it was, as the multitude pressed about Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of 
Gerinesaret, and saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone from them and were 
washing thelr nets. Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked



316

him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the mul- titudes from the boat. 
When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, “Launch out into the deep and let down your nets 
for a catch.” But Simon answered and said to Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught 
nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.” And when they had done this, they 
caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking. So they signaled to their partners in 
the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began 
to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a 
sinful man, O Lord!” For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which 
they had taken; and so also were James andJohn, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. 
And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.” So when they had 
brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him.

Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Je- sus were baptized into His

from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we 
have been united together tn the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness 
of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin 
might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. For he who has died has been 
freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, knowing 
that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. 
For the





death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God 
Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our

“For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and

those of old, ‘You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’ But 1 
say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the 
judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ shall be in danger of the council. But whoever 
says, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of hell fire. Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, 
and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the 
altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. 
Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver

Me three days and have nothing to eat. And if I send them away hungry to their own hous- es, they 
will faint on the way; for some of them have come from afar.” Then His disciples answered Him, “How 
can one satisfy these people with bread here in the wilderness?” He asked them, “How many loaves do 
you have?” And they said, “Seven.” So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. And He 
took the seven loaves and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples to set before 
them; and they set them before the multitude. They also had a few small fish; and having blessed 
them, He said to set them also before them. So they ate and were filled, and they took up seven 
large baskets of leftover fragments. Now those who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent 
them away,

fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them. Not

Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as

sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.” Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of 
them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell; nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them also 
tempted, and were destroyed by serpents; nor complain, as some of them also complained, and were 
destroyed by the destroyer. Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were 
written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come. Therefore let him who thinks 
he stands take heed lest he fall. No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man;

He also said to His disciples: “There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation 
was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods. So he called him and said to him, ‘What is 
this 1 hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.’ 
“Then the steward said within himself, ‘What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship 
away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg. I have resolved what to do, that when I am put out 
of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.’ “So he called every one of his master's 
debtors to him, and said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ And he said, ‘A hundred 
measures of oil.’ So he said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.' Then 
he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ So he said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ And he 
said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’ So the master com- mended the unjust steward 
because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sows of this world are more shrewd in their generation than 
the sons of light.

receive you into an everlasting home.

Now concerriing spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant: You know that you were

that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say thatJesus is 
Lord except by the Holy Spirit. There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are 
differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of activities, but 1t is 
the same God who works all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the 
profit of all: for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of 
knowledge through the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of 
healings by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another 
discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to an- other the interpretation of 
tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, dlstributing to each one individually

and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to 
you—unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: 
that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, arid that He was buried, arid that He 
rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the 
twelve. After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part 
remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep. After that He was seen by James, then by all 
the apostles. Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time. For 1 am the 
least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church 
of GB But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I 
labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of md which was with me.

Gospel. Luke 18:9—14.
Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised 
others: “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The 
Pharisee stood and





prayed thus with himself, ‘God, I thank You that I am not like other men— extortioners, unjust, 
adulterers, or even as this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I 
possess.’ And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, 
but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me a sinner!’ I tell you, this man went down to 
his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he 
who humbles himself will be exalted.”

Epistle. 2 Corinthians 3:4-11.
And we have such trust through Christ toward God. Not that we are suf- ficient of ourselves to 
think of anything as being from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God, who also made us 
sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter 
kills, but the Spirit gives life. But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stories, 
was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because 
of the glory of his countenance, which glory was passing away, how will the ministry of the Spirit 
not be more glori- ous? For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righ- 
teousness exceeds much more in glory. For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, 
because of the glory that excels. For if what is passing away was glorious, what remains is much 
more glorious.

Again, departing from the region of Tyre and Sidon, He came through the midst of the region of

begged Him to put His hand on him. And He took him aside from the multitude, and put His fingers in 
his ears, and He spat and touched hi5 tongue. Then, looking up to heaven, He sighed, and said to 
him, “Eph- phatha,” that is, “Be opened.” Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of 
his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly. Then He com- manded them that they should tell no one; 
but the more He commanded them, the more widely they proclaimed it. And they were astonished be-

Epistle. Galatians 3:15-22.
Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though it is only a man's covenant, yet if it is confirmed, 
no one annuls or adds to it. Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, 
“And to seeds,” as of many, but as of one, “And to your Seed,” who is Christ. And this I say, that 
the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was 
confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect. For if the 
inheritance is of the law, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise. What 
purpose then does the law serve? lt was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come 
to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator. Now a 
mediator does not mediate for one only, but God is one. Is the law then against the promises of 
God? Certainly not! For if there had



33J

been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. But 
the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given 
to those who believe.

Then He turned to His disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes which see the things you 
see; for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not 
seen it, and to hear what you hear, and have not heard it.” And behold, a certain lawyer stood up 
and tested Him, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” He said to him, “What 
is wrltten in the law? What is your reading of it?” So he answered and said, “ ‘You shall love the 
Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your 
mind,’ arid ‘your neighbor as yourself.’ ” And He said to him, “You have answered rightly; do this 
and you will live.” But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” 
Then Jesus answered and said: “A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among 
thieves, who stripped him of his clothing, wounded him, and de- parted, leaving him half dead. Now 
by chance a certain priest came down that road. And when he saw him, he passed by on the other 
side. Likewise a Levite, when he arrived at the place, came and looked, and passed by on the other 
side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had 
compassion. So he went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on 
his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he 
took out two denarii, gave them to the inn- keeper, and said to him, ‘Take care of him; and 
whatever more you spend, when I come again, I will repay you.’ So which of these three do you think 
was neighbor to htm who fell among the thieves?” And he said, “He who showed mercy on him.” Then 
Jesus satd to him, “Go and do likewise.”

I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh 
lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, 
so that you do not do the things that you wish. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under 
the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, 
lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish 
ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I 
tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will 
not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, 
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. And those 
who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

And they lifted up their voices and said, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” So when He saw them, 
He said to them, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And so it was that as they went, they were 
cleansed. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice 
glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks. And he was a Samaritan. 
SoJesus answered and said,






Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? Were there not any found who returned to give 
glory to God except this foreigner?” And He said to him, “Arise, go your way. Your faith has made

to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. But let each one examine his own work, 
and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. For each one shall bear his 
own load. Let htm who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches. Do not be 
deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he wlll also reap. For he who sows to 
his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap 
everlast- ing life. And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if 
we do not lose heart. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those

do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will dririk; nor about your body, what

than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; 
yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Which of you by worrying 
can add one cubit to his stature? So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the 
field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his 
glory was not arrayed like one of these. Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today 
is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? 
Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we 
wear?’ For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need 
all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things 
shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for to- morrow will worry about its 
own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.”

on the Sabbath?” But they kept silent. And He took him and healed him, and let him go. Then He 
answered them, saying, “Which of you, hav- ing a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will 
not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?” And they could not answer Him regarding these 
things. So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the best 
places, saying to them: “When you are in- vited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in 
the best place, lest one more honorable than you be invited by him; and he who invited you and him 
come and say to you, ‘Give place to this man,’ and then you begin with shame to take the lowest 
place. But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who invited 
you comes he may say to you, ‘Friend, go up higher.’ Then you will have glory in the pres- ence of 
those who sit at the table with you. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles 
himself will be exalted.”

But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. Then one 
of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying, “Teacher, which is the great 
commandment in the law?” Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, 
with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and great commandment. And the 
second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments hang all 
the Law and the Prophets.” While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, saying, 
“What do you think about the Christ? Whose Son is He?” They said to Him, “The Son of David.” He 
said to them, “How then does David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord,’ saying: ‘The Lord said to my 
Lord, “Sit at My right hand, Till 1 make Your enemies Your footstool” ’? If David then calls Him 
‘Lord,’ how is He his Son?” And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor from that day on did 
anyone dare question Him anymore.

So He got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own city. Then be- hold, they brought to Him a 
paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, be of good 
cheer; your sins are forgiven you.” And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, “This 
Man blasphemes!” But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts? 
For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk’? But that 
you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”—then He said to the para- 
lytic, “Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.” And he arose and departed to his house. Now 
when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such power to men.

And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said: “The kingdom of heaven is like a 
certain king who arranged a marriage for his son, and sent out his servants to call those who were 
invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come. Again, he sent out other servants, 
saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are 
killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding.” ’ But they made light of it and went their 
ways, one to his own farm, another to his business. And the rest seized his servants, treated them 
spitefully, and killed them. But when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent out his 
armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. Then he said to his servants, ‘The 
wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. Therefore go into the highways, and 
as many as you find, invite to the wedding.’ So those servants went out into the highways and 
gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with 
guests. “But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a 
wedding garment. So he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here with- out a wedding garment?’ 
And he was speechless. Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, 
and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ For many are 
called, but few are chosen.”

SoJesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain 
nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. When he heard that Jesus had come out of Jridea into 
Galilee, he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of 
death. Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will by no means 
believe.” The nobleman said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!” Jesus said to him, “Go 
your way; your son lives.” So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his 
way. And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, “Your son lives!” 
Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said to him, “Yesterday at the 
seventh hour the fever left him.” So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus 
said to him, “Your son lives.” And he himself believed, and





his whole household. This again is the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into 
Galilee.

his master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and that 
payment be made. The ser- vant therefore fell down before him, saying, ‘Master, have patience with 
me, and I will pay you all.’ Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released 
him, and forgave him the debt. But that ser- vant went out and found one of his fellow servants who 
owed him a hun- dred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, say- ing, ‘Pay 
me what you owe!’ So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have 
patience with me, and I will pay you all.’ And he would not, but went and threw him into prison 
till he should pay the debt. So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very 
grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done. Then his master, after he had 
called him, said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I for- gave you all that debt because you begged me. 
Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?’ And his 
master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him. 
So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his 
brother his trespasses.”

us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” ButJesus perceived 
their wickedness, and said, “Why do you test Me, you hypocrites? Show Me the tax money.” So they

Gospel. Matthew s:l8-26.
While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, “My daughter 
has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she w1l1 live.” So Jesus arose and followed 
him, and so did His dis- ciples. And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years 
came from behind and touched the hem of His garment. For she said to herself, “If only I may touch 
His garment, 1 shall be made well.” ButJesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, “Be of 
good cheer, daugh- ter; your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour. 
When Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute play- ers and the noisy crowd wailing, He 
said to them, “Make room, for the girl is not dead, but sleeplng.” Arid they ridiculed Him. But 
when the crowd was put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. And the 
report of this went out into all that land.

beseech Thee, cause Thy Word to bring forth in us abundant fruit, that we may daily grow in the

into peaceful repose, defend us, we beseech Thee, from perplexing doubts, and enable us in firm 
faith to take Thee at Thy word, and to experience Thy power, imparted to us daily from Thy Word, 
that we may obtain eternal life; for Thy holy name's sake, who liveth, etc.

Epistle. 1 Thessalonians 4:13—18.
But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you 
sorrow as others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God 
will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that 
we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are 
asleep. For the Lord Hlmself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, 
and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and 
remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we 
shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.

Gospel. Matthew 24:15—28.
“Therefore when you see the ‘abomlnation of desolation,’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing 
in the holy place” (whoever reads, let him understand), “then let those who are in Judea flee to 
the mountains. Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of hts house. And 
let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. But woe to those who are pregnant and 
to those who are nursing babies in those days! And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on 
the Sabbath.
£-or  then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world 
until this time, no, nor ever shall be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be 
saved; but for the elect's sake those days will be shortened. Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, 
here is the Christ!’ or ‘There!’ do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise 
and show great signs and wonders to deceive, lf pos- sible, even the elect. See, I have told you 
beforehand. Therefore if they say to you, ‘Look, He is in the desert!’ do not go out; or ‘Look, He 
is in the inner rooms!’ do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to 
the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For wherever the carcass is, there the 
eagles will be gathered together.”

Epistle and Gospel Collects.
(Ep.)  Almighty and everlasting God, who by Thy Son hast promised us forgiveness of sins and 
deliverance from everlasting death, strengthen us, we beseech Thee, by Thy Holy Spirit, that our 
trust in Thy grace in Christ Jesus may daily increase, and that with sure confidence we may hold 
fast the blessed hope that we shall not die, but only sleep, and at the last day be raised up unto 
everlasting life; through the same Thy Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, who liveth, etc.






(G.)   O Lord Jesus Christ, who wilt come again in majesty to judge the quick and the dead, and 
call forth all who sleep in the graves, either to the resurrection of life or to the resurrection 
of condemnation: we beseech Thee to be gracious unto us, and to raise us from the death of sin unto 
the life of righteousness, that, when we shall depart this life, we may rest in Thee, and, having 
been found acceptable in Thy sight, may on the last day be raised up to life everlasting, inherit 
the kingdom prepared for us from the foundation of the world, and give Thee glory and praise, world 
without end. Amen.

[K]nowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking ac- cording to their own 
lusts, and saying, “Where is the promise of His com- ing? For since the fathers fell asleep, all 
things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.” For this they willfully forget: that 
by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, 
by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water. But the heavens and the 
earth which are now pre- served by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day ofjudgment 
arid perdition of ungodly men. But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one 
day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning His 
promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that arty should per- 
ish but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the 
night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with 
fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Therefore, since all 
these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and 
godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens 
will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, 
according to HiS pr mlse, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteous- ness dwells. 
Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be dili- gent to be found by Him in peace, 
without spot and blameless;
or,
2 Thessalonians 1:3-10.
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, be- cause your faith grows 
exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other, so that we ourselves 
boast of you among the churches of God for your patience arid faith in all your persecutions and 
tribulations that you endure, which is manifest evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you 
may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer; since it is a righteous 
thing with God to repay with tribulation those who trouble you, and to give you who are troubled 
rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire 
taking vengeance on those who do not know Ood, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord 
Jesus Christ. These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the

Lord and from the glory of H1S power, when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified 1n His saints and 
to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you was believed.

“When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, them He will sit on the 
throne of His glory. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one 
from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. And He will set the sheep on His 
right hand, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, 
you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 
for I was hungry and you gave Me food; 1 was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and 
you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; 1 was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and 
you came to Me.’ Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and 
feed You, or thirsty and give You drirrk? When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked 
and clothe You? Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ And the King will 
answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of 
these My brethren,‘ you did it to Me.’ Then He will also say to those on the left hand, ‘Depart 
from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was 
hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink; 1 was a stranger and you 
did not take Me in, na- ked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit 
Me.’ Then they also will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You





hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’ Then 
He will answer them, saying, ‘Assuredly, 1 say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the 
least of these, you did not do it to Me.’ And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but 
the righteous into eternal life.”

Epistle. I Thessalonians 5:1—11.
But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you. 
For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. For 
when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a 
pregnant woman. And they shall not escape. But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day 
should overtake you as a thief. You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the 
night nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober. For



36S
those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night. But let us who are of 
the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of 
salvation. For God did not ap- point us to wrath, but to obtaln salvation through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him. Therefore 
comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.

Gospel. Matthew 25:i-13.
“Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to 
meet the bridegroom. Now five of them were wise, and five were foolish. Those who were foolish took 
their lamps and took no oil with them, but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. But 
while the brldegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight a cry was heard: 
‘Behold, the bridegroom is com- ing; go out to meet him!’ Then all those virgins arose arid trimmed 
their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going 
out.’ But the wise answered, saying, ‘No, lest there should not be enough for us and you; but go 
rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’ And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, 
and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut. Afterward the 
other virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ But he answered and said, ‘Assuredly, I 
say to you, I do not know you.’ Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which 
the Son of Man is coming.”
